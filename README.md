use examples to eradicate blindness.
    1. create a proposition(which is free from the defect of having much exceptions).
    2. test the proposition.
    3. repeat.


i think i know that_which_is_worth_knowing but i_do_NOT_really_know_it.
that_which_is_self_evident is full of danger. BEWARE.
(moodha nammakamu)

whatever good has been "done by me", is done by me in Reality?
😜😜😜
can i dare to be innocent in this nightmarish_Reality?
why is knowledge the same as SELF?
because by doing LESS,
    by merely trying to see,
    by simply knowing,
    greater things are realized by the self at will.
IF the_right_knowledge can help the self fix the_problem_in_Reality easily;
THEN is not the realer problem to help the self gain access to the_right_knowledge?


allready know that FAILURE FEEDS SUCCESS?
O darling, SUCCESS FEEDS SUCCESS also.

is the __re-freshing__ of the self aimless?
drinking a sip of water is bereft of joy?

dealing with AIM that is "significant"?
    • take the time to build a_small_real_specific_easy_imperfect_AIM.
    • create a simple plan in order to realize the_AIM.
    • complete the plan.

do i need to bombard my tiny self with multitudes of aims in the twinkling of an eye?
COME ON i have just started! please provide me certain freedom with respect to Time.
am i bound to witness each aim of mine perish right in front of me?
is not **interesting** a key word with respect to the door of finer details?
am i incapable of realizing a desire through a carefully created plan?

IF the self is capable of doing the perception of "how to get it done?";
THEN it is NOT fun?

enjoying NOT writing on a piece of _paper_?
am i NOT being horribly wrong at certain things in Reality?
a brilliant question is NOT a stupid question?







IF i think it is NOT simple,
THEN i can think i know ANY thing about it?
IF i think it is simple;
THEN i can think i know ANY thing about it?
IF i do not know enough,
THEN do i need to pretend that i allready do?

IF i do not read **_this_** text;
THEN something bad may happen?
do i not need to give myself the freedom to know it 3 times?
am i fearing not being able to stop myself from fearing?
improving the workings of profit-loss-complex is not known to me?
it is clear if and only if i can speak it out loud in a way that originates from a self-evident root.


is that_which_i_want_to_be_in_Reality NOT that_which_is_worthy_of_being_known_by_the_self?
IF the problem is fixed by the self,
THEN is the answer to _how the problem has been fixed by the self?_ NOT significant?










**light_of_hope:**
    that_which_seems_impossible_to_be_done in_a_certain_way can NOT be that_which_can_be_done_with_ease in_a_certain_way?
    what seems like the problem worth fixing is NOT the real problem at play?
    is NOT the real problem creating my own future self such that it is able to fix certain problems with ease?
    2 problems can add up and give me 0 problems.
    fixing 1 problem can fix MANY problems?
    creating 1 problem can NOT fix MANY problems?


**fun_attitudes:**
    it is NOT about "mathematics"; it is about witnessing BEAUTY.
    let me fail in awesome ways!
    WOW!!! what a weird Creation.
    it is a matter of great good fortune to come to experience this root cause finding!
    the "harder" the problem, greater the opportunity to learn. learning is fun!!!
    not sure? try to know it for real. why to guess it?
    failure is a good news. why? because i get to know "i missed to know that_which_is_worth_knowing.".
    i am getting to know more and more of that_which_is_worth_knowing.
    my desire is just to know the answer to "why can i NOT get the problem fixed?"; it is NOT to get the problem fixed.
    why do i have a certain belief in it being NOT possible to be done by me?
    can i NOT do ANY thing with respect to the usefull things i have had the opportunity to create?
    what is so genius, so special about me to have that problem fixed in Reality? it is all just a delusion.
    am i NOT the friend of "machine"? do i want it to execute instructions aimlessly?
    i still do not know the answer of the_WHY_question!

**beliefs_i_cherish:**
    IF i do not know how to do a_certain_thing in Reality;
    THEN is it is NOT possible for me to do it?
    IF i do not know how to do a_certain_thing in Reality;
    THEN is it NOT possible for me to know how to do it?
    IF i know how to get a_certain_thing done in Reality;
    THEN is it NOT possible for me to do it?
    IF i know how to get a_certain_thing done in Reality;
    THEN have i allready done it?

    IF i do NOT know a_certain_thing;
    THEN is it NOT possible for me to know it?
    IF i do NOT know a_certain_thing;
    THEN do i allready know it?
    IF i do know a_certain_thing;
    THEN can i NOT have faith in "i know it."?

    IF i have NOT done a_certain_thing allready;
    THEN is it NOT possible for me to do it?
    IF i have done a_certain_thing allready;
    THEN is it NOT possible for me to do it?

    IF i start taking my own creation for granted;
    THEN will i NOT be able to create it again?

    IF i can NOT get it done NOW;
    THEN i can NOT get it done with respect to Time?

    IF i do not know what i want to be done;
    THEN is it NOT possible for me to know what i want to be done?



**real_time_perceptions_in_problems_environment:**
    from having not a single clue with a fearfull attitude surrounding it's existence to i myself will say "what else is there in it?".
    how much energy can it take from me after all?
    good things just take time BUT is it that much?

    IF the chosen way of investigation in a problems-environment is NOT good enough,
    THEN will i not RE-DOUBT my own correct conclusions with respect to exceptions?
    am i aware of all the mistakes i am prone to make?
    will i not MISS-TAKE right for wrong?

    once i know what i am missing to be on the right way, the only thing i can think of is "what was i thinking all this time!";
    i am also become unable to make sense of the logic that i was thinking as correct.
    it is weird.

    many problems can be fixed without making my friendly machine do MUCH things; less conditions, less instructions, clear instructions, less exceptions.


**sad_truths_with_respect_to_my_self:**
    i equate let_me_try_to_know with let_me_Father_Up_Can_Know.
    i know that i am doing something wrong. i know what i am doing wrong. i know that i can fix it easily. i do not fix it. i lose faith in something about my own self for some strange reason... 
    the moment i look at an unknown thing, i develop certain beliefs with respect to it. not for good reasons...
    (i am afraid of knowing what i want?
    am i afraid of knowing that i am incapable of knowing what i want?
    am i afraid of finding out that it is not doable?
    i am afraid of not being able to find what i missed?
    i am afraid of knowing that there is something worth knowing in it?
    i am afraid of coming to know of more than 1 AIMs?
    i am afraid of failing to find that which i assume to be a certain way but is NOT?
    i am afraid of "what will i do IF i fail at finding why it does not work?" before i even start.)
    encountering failure makes me lose faith in certain things!!! i question things i know to be true!!
    i think possible things to be impossible. i think impossible things to be possible.
    i think it is impossible for me to take things for granted the right way.

    i have a strange belief,
    "i am incapable of seeing what it is doing in the true light!"
    "i am afraid of seeking answer to the question "what is that_which_can_go_wrong in here?"
    "IF i verify each part of a problem-creating system for what is it that i did wrong with it;
    THEN i will not find ANY part that is wrong in the way it is being used."
    i try to fix that part which is allready working good.
    (i think i have done the verification of the part BUT the way in which i verify, i have not verified!)
    here is how i am usually wrong : 
        1) i claim "the answer is NO only in this case" without going through the entire code.
        2) assuming that (false)claim i proceed to examine what i must have done wrong.
        3) of course i will never find what i did wrong THERE because i am searching in the place that i did right!
    
    just because i have a certain belief of "i can not possibly do that", i proceed to think in a different way!!
    i do not even know what i am trying to do! but i force myself to do it and also punish myself if failure is encountered.

    i make up theories but i do not make up tests to test the theories. what i do make instead of tests is self-hate as to why i made the theories!
    i proceed to fix 1 problem but i start working on fixing a different problem while having forgotten the original problem.
