### it is clear if and only if i can speak it out loud in a way that originates from a self-evident root.

start writing on a piece of _paper_.
i am the friend of "machine", i do not want to make it execute instructions aimlessly.
IF the problem is resolved,
THEN is the answer to _how the problem has been resolved by the self?_ NOT significant?

am i fearing not being able to stop myself from fearing?

is that_which_i_want_to_be NOT that_which_is_worthy_of_being_known_by_the_self_in_Reality?

IF i do not know enough,
THEN do i need to pretend that i allready do? let me see what else can be known by me!

IF i think it is not-at-all simple,
THEN i can think i know ANY thing about it?
what seems impossible to be done in a way is very easy to do in a different way.
2 problems can add up and give me 0 problems.

just know that whatever good has been "done by me", is not really done by me!!!
a feeling of loss known as nostalgia is NOT capable of destroying the future?

knowledge is power.
ever wondered why?
because by doing LESS,
    by merely trying to see,
    by simply knowing,
greater things are realized by the self at will.

PROOF(the_why_it_MUST_be_true) is what rules, use examples to eradicate blindness;
    1. **create a proposition** that is free from the defect of much exceptions.
    2. test the proposition for being true or NOT.
    3. repeat exhaustively.

want to attain freedom from fear?
fear is not a belief in the self not being able to realize a desire?
in the need of a_fix_that_silences_the_voice_of_doubts?
"INTERESTING..." is the key word!
not enjoying writing on a text?


dealing with an AIM that i view as significant.
â€¢ take the time to build a_small_real_specific_easy_imperfect_AIM.
â€¢ have a simple dream of realizing the_AIM.
â€¢ repeat the aforementioned.
