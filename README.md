### sharpening the pencil before i can write.
i am wrong. in many ways.

IF i do not read the README.md;
THEN something bad may happen?

it is clear if and only if i can speak it out loud in a way that originates from a self-evident root.


what seems like the problem worth fixing is NOT the real problem at play.
the real problem is creating my own future self such that it is able to fix certain problems with ease.

am i fearing not being able to stop myself from fearing?
is the RE-FRESHING of the self aimless?

that_which_seems_impossible_to_be_done can be very easy to do in a way.
2 sources of problems can add up and give me 0 sources of problems.
whatever good has been "done by me", is NOT really done by me?
ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ

knowledge is power? never wondered why?
because by doing LESS,
    by merely trying to see,
    by simply knowing,
greater things are realized by the self AT will.

PROOF(the_why_it_MUST_be_true) is what rules; use examples to eradicate blindness.
    1. **create a proposition** that is free from the defect of much exceptions.
    2. seek a proof in order to test the proposition for being true or NOT.
    3. test the proposition.
    4. repeat and watch the problem being solved easily.



dealing with an AIM that i view as significant?
    â€¢ take the time to build a_small_real_specific_easy_imperfect_AIM.
    â€¢ have a simple dream of realizing the_AIM.
    â€¢ repeat.



IF the chosen way of investigation in a problems-environment is NOT good enough,
THEN will i not RE-DOUBT my own correct conclusions with respect to exceptions?
am i aware of all the mistakes i am prone to make?
will i not MISS-TAKE right for wrong?









improving the memory of profit/loss is not known to me?
i like to think that i am the knower of that which is worth knowing,
i like to think that i am the doer of that which is worth doing,
i like to think that i am worthy of all wonderfully loving things!


want to attain freedom from a belief in the self not being able to realize a desire?
in the need of a_fix_that_silences_the_voice_of_doubts?
it is NOT about how to get a problem fixed, it is about immersing myself in the problems-environment.
"INTERESTING" is the key word!

is that_which_i_want_to_be NOT that_which_is_worthy_of_being_known_by_the_self_in_Reality?
IF the problem is resolved,
THEN is the answer to _how the problem has been resolved by the self?_ NOT significant?

IF i think it is not-at-all simple,
THEN i can think i know ANY thing about it?
IF i do not know enough,
THEN do i need to pretend that i allready do?

NOT enjoying writing on a piece of _paper_?
am i NOT the friend of "machine"?
do i want it to execute instructions aimlessly?

IF the machine executes various processes in a rule-based ordered way,
THEN many problems can be fixed without making it do MUCH things.
less conditions, less instructions, clear instructions, less exceptions.


many things are good enough if known once BUT 
do i not need to give myself the freedom to know it 3 times???
from having not a single clue with a fearfull attitude surrounding it's existence to
i myself will say "what else is there in it?" how much energy can it take from me after all?
