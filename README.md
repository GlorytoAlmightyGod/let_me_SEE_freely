# not required to sharpen the pencil?

i like to think "i allready know that_which_is_worth_knowing!"?
that_which_is_self_evident is full of DANGER. (moodha nammakamu = a belief of the innocent)
i need hope in the right way!

am i bound to witness each aim of mine perish right in front of me?
do i need to bombard my tiny self with multitudes of aims in the twinkling of an eye?
am i incapable of realizing a desire through a carefully created plan?
is not **interesting** a key word with respect to the door of finer details?
not enjoying writing on a piece of _paper_?

IF i think it is not-at-all simple,
THEN i can think i know ANY thing about it?
IF i do not know enough,
THEN do i need to pretend that i allready do?
IF my self is oriented the right way;
THEN i wonder "what is so genius, so special about me to have that problem fixed in Reality? it is all just a delusion"... weird Creation.




IF i do not read **_this_** text;
THEN something bad may happen?
do i not need to give myself the freedom to know it 3 times?
am i fearing not being able to stop myself from fearing?
improving the workings of profit-loss-complex is not known to me?
it is clear if and only if i can speak it out loud in a way that originates from a self-evident root.

from having not a single clue with a fearfull attitude surrounding it's existence to i myself will say "what else is there in it?".
how much energy can it take from me after all?
good things just take time BUT is it that much?




is that_which_i_want_to_be_in_Reality NOT that_which_is_worthy_of_being_known_by_the_self?
IF the problem is fixed by the self,
THEN is the answer to _how the problem has been fixed by the self?_ NOT significant?



that_which_seems_impossible_to_be_done is NOT that_which_can_be_done_with_ease in a_certain_way?
what seems like the problem worth fixing is NOT the real problem at play.
the real problem is creating my own future self such that it is able to fix certain problems with ease.
2 sources of problems can add up and give me 0 sources of problems.
fixing 1 problem can fix a certain problem.
creating 1 problem can fix a certain problem.
whatever good has been "done by me", is NOT really done by me?
ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ
why is knowledge the same as power?
because by doing LESS,
    by merely trying to see,
    by simply knowing,
    greater things are realized by the self at will.
IF the_right_knowledge can help the self fix the_problem_in_Reality easily;
THEN is not the realer problem to help the self gain access to the_right_knowledge?

PROOF(the_why_it_MUST_be_true) is what rules; use examples to eradicate blindness.
    1. **create a proposition** which is free from the defect of having much exceptions.
    2. test the proposition.
    3. repeat.



dealing with AIM that is "significant"?
    â€¢ take the time to build a_small_real_specific_easy_imperfect_AIM.
    â€¢ create a simple plan in order to realize the_AIM.
    â€¢ complete the plan.
    â€¢ repeat.




am i NOT the friend of "machine"?
do i want it to execute instructions aimlessly?
many problems can be fixed without making it do MUCH things; less conditions, less instructions, clear instructions, less exceptions.

IF i do NOT know a_certain_thing;
THEN is it NOT possible for me to know it?

IF i do know a_certain_thing;
THEN can i NOT have faith in "i know it."?

IF i have NOT done a_certain_thing allready;
THEN is it NOT possible for me to do it?

IF i start taking my own creation for granted;
THEN will i not be able to create it again?

IF i can NOT get it done NOW;
THEN i can NOT get it done with respect to Time?


IF i do not know what i want to be done;
THEN is it NOT possible for me to know what i want to be done?
IF i do not know how to do what i want to be done;
THEN is it NOT possible for me to know how to do it? is it NOT possible for me to do it?

just because i have a certain belief of "i can not possibly do that", i proceed to think in a different way!!
i do not even know what i am trying to do! but i force myself to do it and also punish myself if failure is encountered.


a brilliant question is NOT a stupid question?

once i know what i am missing to be on the right way, the only thing i can think of is "what was i thinking all this time!";
i am also become unable to make sense of the logic that i was thinking as correct.
it is weird.


allready know that FAILURE FEEDS SUCCESS?
O darling, SUCCESS FEEDS SUCCESS also.

is the **re-freshing** of the self aimless?
drinking a sip of water is bereft of joy?



(i am afraid of knowing what i want?
am i afraid of knowing that i am incapable of knowing what i want?
am i afraid of finding out that it is not doable?
i am afraid of not being able to find what i missed?
i am afraid of knowing that there is something worth knowing in it?
i am afraid of coming to know of more than 1 AIMs?
i am afraid of failing to find that which i assume to be a certain way but is NOT?
i am afraid of "what will i do IF i fail at finding why it does not work?" before i even start.)
encountering failure makes me lose faith in certain things!!! i question things i know to be true!!
i think possible things to be impossible. i think impossible things to be possible.


i have a strange belief,
"i am incapable of seeing what it is doing in the true light!"
"i am afraid of seeking answer to the question "what is that_which_can_go_wrong in here?"
"IF i verify each part of a problem-creating system for what is it that i did wrong with it;
THEN i will not find ANY part that is wrong in the way it is being used."
i try to fix that part which is allready working good.
(i think i have done the verification of the part BUT the way in which i verify, i have not verified!)
here is how i am usually wrong : 
    1) i claim "the answer is NO only in this case" without going through the entire code.
    2) assuming that (false)claim i proceed to examine what i must have done wrong.
    3) of course i will never find what i did wrong because i am searching in the place that i did right!

IF the self is capable of doing the perception of "how to get it done?";
THEN it is NOT fun?

IF i need to educate myself about what is very significant to know,
THEN i am allready dead!!!


IF the chosen way of investigation in a problems-environment is NOT good enough,
THEN will i not RE-DOUBT my own correct conclusions with respect to exceptions?
am i aware of all the mistakes i am prone to make?
will i not MISS-TAKE right for wrong?



usefull_attitudes(allways get to the why!):
    it is a matter of great good fortune to come to experience this root cause finding!
    the "harder" the problem, greater the opportunity to learn. learning is fun!!!
    failure is a good news. why? because i missed to know that_which_is_worth_knowing.
    i am getting to know more and more of that_which_is_worth_knowing.
    aim is to know the answer to "why i can NOT possibly get the problem fixed?"; it is not to get the problem fixed.
