### not required to sharpen the pencil?

am i incapable of realizing a desire through a plan in Reality?
is not "INTERESTING" interesting key word with respect to finer details?

IF i do not read the README.md;
THEN something bad may happen?
i am being wrong; in many ways.
improving the memory of profit/loss is not known to me?
it is clear if and only if i can speak it out loud in a way that originates from a self-evident root.

do i not need to give myself the freedom to know it 3 times???
am i fearing not being able to stop myself from fearing?
is the RE-FRESHING of the self aimless?

from having not a single clue with a fearfull attitude surrounding it's existence to i myself will say "what else is there in it?".
how much energy can it take from me after all?
good things just take time. BUT not that much!




i like to think that i am the knower of that which is worth knowing,
i like to think that i am the doer of that which is worth doing,
i like to think that i am worthy of all wonderfully loving things!



is that_which_i_want_to_be NOT that_which_is_worthy_of_being_known_by_the_self_in_Reality?
IF the problem is fixed by the self,
THEN is the answer to _how the problem has been fixed by the self?_ NOT significant?

IF i think it is not-at-all simple,
THEN i can think i know ANY thing about it?
IF i do not know enough,
THEN do i need to pretend that i allready do?

NOT enjoying writing on a piece of _paper_?

what seems like the problem worth fixing is NOT the real problem at play.
the real problem is creating my own future self such that it is able to fix certain problems with ease.
that_which_seems_impossible_to_be_done can be very easy to do in a way.
2 sources of problems can add up and give me 0 sources of problems.
whatever good has been "done by me", is NOT really done by me?
ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ
why is knowledge the same as power?
    because by doing LESS,
        by merely trying to see,
        by simply knowing,
    greater things are realized by the self at will.
IF the_right_knowledge can help the self fix the problem easily;
THEN is not the realer problem to help the self gain access to the_right_knowledge?

PROOF(the_why_it_MUST_be_true) is what rules; use examples to eradicate blindness.
    1. **create a proposition** that is free from the defect of much exceptions.
    2. test the proposition.
    3. repeat.



dealing with an AIM that i view as significant?
    â€¢ take the time to build a_small_real_specific_easy_imperfect_AIM.
    â€¢ have a simple plan in order to realize the_AIM.
    â€¢ repeat.




am i NOT the friend of "machine"?
do i want it to execute instructions aimlessly?
IF the machine executes various processes in a rule-based ordered way;
THEN many problems can be fixed without making it do MUCH things.
less conditions, less instructions, clear instructions, less exceptions.

(i am afraid of knowing what i want?
am i afraid of knowing that i am incapable of knowing what i want?
am i afraid of finding out that it is not doable?
i am afraid of not being able to find what i missed?
i am afraid of knowing that there is something worth knowing in it?
i am afraid of coming to know of more than 1 AIMs?
i am afraid of failing to find that which i assume to be a certain way but is NOT?)

i can not have a belief in "I (ALLREADY) KNOW THIS!!!"?

IF i do not know what i want to be done;
THEN is it NOT possible for me to know what i want to be done?
IF i do not know how to do what i want to be done;
THEN is it NOT possible for me to know how to do it? is it NOT possible for me to do it?

just because i have a certain belief of "i can not possibly do that", i proceed to think in a different way!!
i do not even know what i am trying to do! but i force myself to do it and also punish myself if failure is encountered.
