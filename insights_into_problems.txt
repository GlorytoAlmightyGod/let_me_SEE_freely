context is just a collection of variables...
context is just a collection of variables...
    1. perception of vital IF-THEN relationships,
    2. proper variable(property perception) declaration,
    3. proper function calling,
    4. usage of NOT.
    5. Tao is at play on Tao in a Tao way...(that is why everything is sooo confusing.)
can take the self a loooong way...
IF i can see through it,
THEN it is not fun anymore?


perception of what was done right itself is NOT right?
NOT guilty of losing the sight of that_which_is_significant?
how to get this problem fixed?
    what if that is the case?
    what if this is the case?
    what if these cases are the same in essence?
    what if it is impossible to have such cases?

what is it that i want to be done?
what am i assuming to be true?
what is the hidden proposition here?
what imaginations can i use to test propositions?
why is the proposition true?
"let me try being clearer..."

draw up certain properties of the ideal fix of the problem.

a property is the relationship a thing has with the underlying-problems-environment in Reality.
