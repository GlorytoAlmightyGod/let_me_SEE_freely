Reality is the ultimate context.

JUST DO IT.

IF the machine executes various processes in a rule-based ordered way,
THEN many problems can be fixed without doing ANY thing. less conditions, less instructions, clear instructions.

context is just a collection of variables...
    1. perception of vital IF-THEN relationships,
    2. proper variable(property perception) declaration,
    3. proper function calling,
    4. usage of NOT.
    5. Tao is at play on Tao in a Tao way...(that is why everything is sooo confusing.)
can take the self a loooong way...
IF i can see through it,
THEN it is not fun anymore?

conclusions are created using proofs.
a proposition brings with it a need(problem) for proof.


perception of what was done right itself is NOT right?
NOT guilty of losing the sight of that_which_is_significant?
how to get this problem fixed?
    what if that is the case?
    what if this is the case?
    what if these cases are the same in essence?
    what if it is impossible to have such cases?

how can i think that without proof?
what is it that i want to be done?
what am i assuming to be true?
what is the hidden proposition here?
what imaginations can i use to test propositions?
why is the proposition true?
what am i missing?
"let me try being clearer..."

draw up certain properties of the ideal fix of the problem.

a property is the relationship a thing has with the underlying-problems-environment in Reality.

properties of an "AIM".
    incomplete.
    very specific. not generic.
    hidden. self-evident in what to do.
    new.
    realistic.
    imperfect.
    finite.
    assumes uselessness but is usefull.
    short-lifespan.
    dirty.
    works.(it should work, but sometimes it does not. accidentally undoes the work.)
    tested.
    named.
    1-at-a-time.
